Quasars are galaxies whose central supermassive black hole is growing at such a furious rate that black hole outshines the entire galaxy. Due to their extreme luminosities, quasars can be observed from great distances and provide a tool for mapping structure in the early/distant universe. Unfortunately, quasars can be difficult to find in the first place, since in imaging surveys quasars are often hard to distinguish from stars; both quasars and stars appear as point sources and can have similar colors and magnitudes.
